Navigation bars
_______________

_Navigation Bars present on almost all major websites.

_They allow us to quickly link to other pages on our web applications.

_We can create a "navbar" through the <nav> html tag.

_Bootstrap classes can then be added to the <nav> element to add styling and
function,

_Bootstrap also allows for the easy creation of "collapsing" navbars.

_This means that the "navbar" will adjust to smaller screen sizes with a drop
down menu.
