    <h1> CSS Classes and Ids </h1>
    <ul>
      <p><li> We know that we can select every element of a certain tag type in our CSS file </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Every p element </li>
        <li> Every h1 element </li>
      </ul></p>
      <p><li> But what do we do if we only want to select some of these? Or just one? </li></p>
      <p><li> We've explored "divs" and "spans but these options limit our structure in HTML, having to
        make sure everything is in the same "div" </li></p>
      <p><li> The solution to these issues is the use of "classes" and "ids" in our CSS. </li></p>
      <p><li> Classes are used to assign a CSS style to multiple differetn elements throughout the HTML. </li></p>
      <p><li> Ids are used to apply a style to a single element </li></p>
      <p><li> Ids should be used fro unique elements </li></p>
    </ul>
